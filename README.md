**Overview**

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and accompanying documentation for setting up virtual machines (VMs) with a focus on folder sharing and memory allocation for different operating systems including Ubuntu, Android, and Contiki. The project is designed to help users understand and implement efficient VM environments tailored to various use cases.

**Project Contents**

The project is structured into detailed chapters, each covering specific aspects of virtual machine setup and optimization:

**Chapter 1: **

**Shared Folder Configuration**
Ubuntu Setup: Instructions on creating and sharing a folder between the host machine and the Ubuntu guest OS, complete with screenshots.
Android Setup: Similar guidance for setting up shared folders with an Android guest OS.
Contiki Setup: Steps to establish folder sharing between the host machine and Contiki guest OS.


**Chapter 2:**

**Memory Allocation**
Before Memory Allocation: Examines the default memory usage by Ubuntu, Android, and Contiki when installed as guest OSes on a host laptop.
After Memory Allocation: Demonstrates the impact of memory allocation adjustments on the performance and functionality of each guest OS.



**Chapter 3:**

**Discussion**
This section provides analysis and insights on the observed performances, system efficiency, and potential optimizations based on the configurations applied in Chapter 2.
Technologies Used
Virtualization Software: Instructions and configurations are applicable to common virtualization platforms like VMware, VirtualBox, etc.
